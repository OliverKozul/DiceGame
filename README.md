## **Overview**

A fast-paced **dice-building, rogue-like battle game** where players roll dice, secretly choose actions, and compete for survival. Strategic alliances and betrayals make every round unpredictable.

## **Game Flow**

	- ⚔ **Combat** – Used for attacking or countering players, mobs, or bosses.
	- 🧠 **Cunning** – Determines turn order (higher Cunning acts later).

2. **Simultaneous Turns**
	- All players **roll their dice at the same time**.
	- Players **secretly choose an action** using an action token.

## **Turn Order Resolution**

1. **Initiative = Cunning + Gold Tiebreaker**
	- Players act in ascending Cunning order.
	- If tied, the player with less Gold acts first.
	- If still tied, roll a tiebreaker D6.
2. **Turn Order Applies to All Actions**
	- **Combat, Shopping, and Countering** are resolved in Cunning order.
	- More cunning players can attack or counter less cunning players before they act.
	- In the shop, more cunning players buy first.

## **Actions**

Each round, players can choose one of the following actions:

- **⚔ Attack Player** – Damage another player to weaken their HP.
- **⚔ Attack Mobs** – Defeat minor enemies to gain permanent buffs.
- **⚔ Attack Boss** – Work together (or sabotage) to take down a powerful boss for rare rewards.
- **💰 Buy Item** – Spend Gold to upgrade dice, buy trinkets, or enhance abilities.
- **🛡 Counter Player** – Reduce another player’s Attack before they act.

## **Countering Mechanic**

- Players can allocate **some or all of their Attack points** to counter an opponent.
- Countering reduces the target’s Attack by the allocated amount.
- If an opponent’s Attack is reduced to **zero**, their action fails.
