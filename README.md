## **Overview**

A fast-paced **free-for-all, dice-building, rogue-like battle game** where players roll dice, secretly choose actions, and compete for survival. Strategic alliances and betrayals make every round unpredictable.

## **Game Flow**

1. **Each player starts with one die** (D6) featuring different face types:
    - 🎲 **Gold** – Used to buy new dice faces or items.
    - ⚔ **Combat** – Used for attacking or countering players, mobs, or bosses.
    - 🎁 **Special** – Triggers unique effects based on upgrades.
2. **Simultaneous Turns**
    - All players **roll their dice at the same time**.
    - Players **secretly choose an action** using an action token.
    - Once all actions are locked in, they are **revealed simultaneously** in the **play phase**.

## **Actions**

Each round, players can choose one of the following actions:

- **⚔ Attack Player** – Damage another player to weaken their HP.
- **⚔ Attack Mobs** – Defeat minor enemies to gain permanent buffs.
- **⚔ Attack Boss** – Work together (or sabotage) to take down a powerful boss for rare rewards.
- **💰 Buy Item** – Spend gold to upgrade dice, buy trinkets, or enhance abilities.

## **Combat & Enemies**

### **Mobs (Minor Enemies)**

- Can be defeated by a single player.
- Reward the slayer with **permanent buffs (trinkets)**.

### **Bosses (Major Enemies)**

- High HP and strong attacks.
- Offer **better rewards** but require teamwork—or strategic sabotage.
- Example: A boss with **20 HP** requires **all four players (5 damage each) to attack** to defeat it.
- If only **three players attack**, they fail and take damage—while the fourth player, who chose a different action, benefits instead.
- Players **secretly choose what they want** from the loot pool.
- If only one player picks an item, they get it.
- If multiple players pick the same item a hidden auction takes place.

## **Player Stats & Resources**

- **HP** – Lose all HP and you're eliminated.
- **Trinkets** – Passive bonuses from mobs/boss fights.
- **Dice** – Players can upgrade and customize dice faces over time.
- **Items** – Bought with gold, they grant **special effects or rerolls**.

## **Win Condition**

- The **last player standing** wins.
